## 🏛️ The "Royal Divine" Experience

Hidayah AI is built on a unique design philosophy that prioritizes **Visual Authority** and **Linguistic Depth**:

- **Glassmorphism 2.0**: A semi-transparent "Divine" interface using frosted-glass headers, grain-textured panels, and multi-layered shadows.
- **Sharp Design Tokens**: A technical 2px radius aesthetic that provides a sharp, modern, and authoritative feel compared to generic rounded apps.
- **Midnight & Gold Palette**: A curated contrast between Deep Midnight backgrounds (`#0F172A`) and vibrant Royal Gold accents (`#D4AF37`).
- **Linguistic Trilingualism**: Seamless native support for **Arabic**, **English**, and **Urdu** across both text and audio orchestration.

## 🧠 Advanced AI Orchestration

Hidayah AI leverages the latest in Generative AI to provide unprecedented scholarly depth:

- **Multimodal Intent Routing**: Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to instantaneously classify user queries into Verse Lookup, Scholarly Research, or Document Analysis.
- **Deep Scholarly RAG**: A robust "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" pipeline using **FAISS Vector Search** and **Gemini Embeddings** to query scholarly PDF documents with high precision.
- **Trilingual Audio Engine**: A unique synchronized playback system that orchestrates recitation (e.g., Mishary Rashid) followed by translation-accurate audio (Ibrahim Walk or Shamshad Ali Khan).
- **Graceful Quota Management**: Professional, brand-aligned error masking that replaces technical API jargon with a "Scholar is Resting" status for service interruptions.
